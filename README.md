Text-to-Speech Web Application

A web application that converts text into speech, allowing users to listen to content page by page. Users can start the speech journey from any point in the text, making it interactive and easy to follow.

This project uses gTTS for text-to-speech conversion, Django as the backend framework, and React for the frontend interface.
